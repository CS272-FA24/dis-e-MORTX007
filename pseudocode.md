TODO Your pseudocode goes here!

take the first book in the pile and place it in another pile
take the next one and go through the new pile until the book is alphebetically lower than the next book in the new pile
when it is lower, place it before the book you are checking in the new pile
do this with all books
At the end you should have a sorted pile of books
